 [noun], both alike in dignity,
 In fair [noun], where we lay our scene,
 From ancient [noun] break to new mutiny,
 Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

 A pair of star-cross`d [noun] take their life;
 Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
 Do with their [noun] bury their parents` strife.
 The fearful passage of their [adjective] love,
 And the continuance of their parents` rage,
 Which, but their children`s end, nought could Lurch,
 Is now the 4 hours` traffic of our stage;
 The which if you with politely [verb],
 What here shall Haul, our toil shall strive to mend.
